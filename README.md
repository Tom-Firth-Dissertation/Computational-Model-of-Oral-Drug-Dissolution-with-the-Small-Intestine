Investigations into oral drug dissolution are plagued with ethical and financial costs when we consider in vivo studies (within the living). 
Similarly, considering in vitro studies (within glass) it is inconceivable to accurately mirror the inner workings of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Whether it is the peristaltic motility of the stomach and small intestine, or the microvilli responsible for the increased surface area of each cell, an
accurate model is just beyond our complexity. Therefore, we will aim to develop a more physiologically accurate framework of 
oral drug dissolution via computational modelling; hypothesising that with this new means of modelling, we may be able to provide more beneficial 
insights into how to improve the way we design and manufacture common  oral medication, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and so forth.
